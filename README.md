# Rubiks-Cube-Solver

I have represented Rubik's cube as a 3d, 1d, and Bitboard model.
Further, DFS, BFS, and IDDFS algorithms have been applied to it to solve the Rubik's cube.
To get faster results, the IDA* algorithm has been implemented.

To enhance it further, I have finally implemented IDA* algorithm along with Corner Patten Database as suggested in 
the paper published by Richard E. Korf on "Finding optimal solutions to Rubik's Cube using Pattern Databases".

The algorithm can solve a Rubik's Cube jumbled up to 10-12 times at its best version.
